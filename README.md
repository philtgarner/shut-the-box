#Shut the Box
A [Shut the Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box) simulator that will tell you what you should have done (if there was a way to complete the game with the given rolls). This has no real practical application and will not help you win or cheat but it will allow you to be the annoying person who chirps up with what someone should have done!

##Shut the Box
Shut the Box is a simple game in which the aim is to drop the tiles numbered 1 to 9. After rolling two dice any number of tiles can be dropped that have a total value of the dice roll. i.e. If you roll a 4 and a 6 (a total value of 10) you could drop the 1 & 9 or 2 & 8 or 3 & 7 or 4 & 6 or 1 & 2 & 7 or ... If you cannot make a move then the game is over.

##This tool
This tool essentially plays all the possible moves, therefore finding any valid solution to the rolls you have made.
